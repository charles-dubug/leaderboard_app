Hello, This is a me using React (tutorial here), create a leaderboard from scratch (though you can use as many resources/libraries as you’d like) with attendees’ points from most points to least points from the HackIllinois API! 

First, I set up a new React project and install any necessary dependencies. You can use Create React App to quickly create a new project:

npx create-react-app leaderboard-app

cd leaderboard-app

npm install axios
